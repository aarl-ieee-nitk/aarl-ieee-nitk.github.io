[**Adversarial Reinforcement Learning**](https://github.com/aarl-ieee-nitk) is a year-long project taken up by a group of members at [**IEEE-NITK**](https://github.com/IEEE-NITK). As a part of this project we aim to explore Adversarial Attacks in Reinforcement Learning, and look for possible defenses. The code for this project can be found in [**this**](https://github.com/IEEE-NITK/Adversarial-Reinforcement-Learning) repository. The video presentation can be found [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Img72wp00) and virtual-expo [**here**](https://ieee.nitk.ac.in/virtual-expo/adversarial-reinforcement-learning/).
